# Hackathon Challenges
The hackathon comprised of 4 challenges where the teams were supposed to use only HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. No frameworks were supposed to be implemented during the hackathon. After completing all the challenges we deployed them to the internet.
1. Website portfolio ---  use this link to access the site
- suppoed to create a website portfolio that will display the About of the group members, Services that we will be offering, Testimonials of the group members
2. Authentication System ---  use this link to access the site [grp-8-to-do.netlify.app](https://grp-8-to-do.netlify.app/)
- the team created an authentication system that used vanilla Javascript that a login page will authenticate a user. After a successful login, the user will be taken to the To-Do list website.
- login page where a user will use the default credentials to sign in

- now when the user enters wrong credentials an error alert appears and the user is alerted on the number of attempts remaining before the user is locked     out. But after successfully signing in is done, the page will redirect to the To-Do list website<br>
